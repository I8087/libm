# mlib
The goal of mlib is to create a clean and nice nonstandard C library for MikeOS that respects the cdecl calling convention. mlib is a C wrapper for all of the MikeOS APIs and it's completely written in assembly (nasm). Currently, the project is undergoing active development and the goal is for it to be finished when MikeOS 4.6 is released.
